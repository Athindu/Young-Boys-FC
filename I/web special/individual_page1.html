		<p>BSC Young Boys are an association football club based in Bern, Switzerland. The first team has won 13 Swiss league championships and six Swiss Cups. In 1957, YB was named the Swiss team of the year. YB is one of the most successful Swiss football clubs internationally, and reached the semi-finals of the European Cup in the 1958–59 season.In the 2010–11 season, the club finished third in the league, which qualified YB to the UEFA Europa League for the next season. The following season was similar for the Yellow-Blacks, finishing third once again in the league. In the same season, YB failed to reach the Europa League group stage after being eliminated by Braga 2–2 on aggregate on the away goals rule (0–0 in Braga; 2–2 in Bern). </p>

		<p>In 28 April 2018, following a 2-1 home win over Luzern, Young Boys were confirmed as 2017–18 Swiss Super League champions, their first league title in 32 years.In 28 August 2018, Young Boys qualified to UEFA Champions League Group Stage for the first time in their history, after defeating Dinamo Zagreb with a 3-2 aggregate score in play-off round.</p>

		<p>Since 2005, Young Boys has played its home matches at the Stade de Suisse Wankdorf in Bern. The stadium seats 31,783 spectators and is the second largest football stadium in Switzerland, after St. Jakob-Park. The construction cost of 350 million francs, which was more than any other building in Switzerland.Officially, there are only stadium seats, but standing tickets are also sold.
		The name arises from the fact that the Stade de Suisse acts as a National Stadium. As one of the few stadiums with artificial turf, however, matches are rarely held there. For UEFA Euro 2008, a natural grass field was to be laid as three group stage matches took place there.</p>
		
		<p>The stadium is also the largest stadium-integrated solar power plant in the world.On the roof of the Stade de Suisse are enough solar cells to generate 700,000 kWh. This seems rather a high figure and would require approximately 300,000 square meters of panels i.e. 30 hectares. The electricity powers the stadium and some houses around the Wankdorf area. Just below the playing field is one of the largest shopping centres in Switzerland and a parking facility with over 700 places. The stadium also includes schools, homes, a fitness center, several gyms and some restaurants. The stadium is near a highway interchange and only a few minutes' drive from the main railway station in Bern and only a few minutes' walk from the new Wankdorfquartier station. Furthermore, there are both a bus and a tram stop near Wankdorf.</p>
